# Road To 1000

LeetCode is a popular platform that offers a vast collection of coding problems to help programmers enhance their skills. By solving problems on LeetCode, I can practice implementing algorithms and data structures, gain a deeper understanding of programming concepts, and improve my problem-solving skills.

I use this repository to document my solutions to LeetCode problems. 

By solving LeetCode problems regularly and documenting my solutions, I hope to build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms that will help me tackle more complex problems in the future.

Goal: Reach 1000+ submissions on LeetCode
